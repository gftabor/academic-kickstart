# Biography

I am a PhD student in the School of Computing at the University of Utah in the robotics track of the [Utah Robotics Center](http://robotics.coe.utah.edu/). I work in the [Utah Learning Lab for Manipulation Autonomy](https://robot-learning.cs.utah.edu/) (LL4MA) and am advised by [Dr. Tucker Hermans](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~thermans/). In my spare time I am a member of the Battlebots team [End Game](https://battlebots.com/robot/end-game/) based out of New Zealand. I also mentor several teams that compete in the [VEX Robotics Competition](https://www.vexrobotics.com/competition) after having spent several years trying to compete fully autonomously against robots controlled by human drivers.
